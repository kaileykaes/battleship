# Reflection

  We used the given functionality checklist as a guide for both our spec tests and our code files.  We created a new class to hold the methods that we anticipated needing (class Game).  We met together for planning purposes and to determine the strategy for iteration 3 and used a combination of async and paired work as we went along.  Github reviews of individual commits were helpful in validating that code and tests both were progressing as needed.

  Dedicating more time to continually reviewing the project requirements and understanding the details given in the iterations would have increased efficiency and ultimately minimized need for refactoring or redoing work.

  If we could have more time to work on this project, we would focus on:
  - Improving user interface and ease of use
  - Method for placement validation - it currently works as is, but within certain parameters (i.e, coordinates need to be entered in consecutively, in ascending order and with spaces in between the coordinates)
  - Refactoring in general
  - Testing - add testing particularly for integration and edge-cases 

  We used a combination of ping-pong, async work, and paired work on this project.  Using a combination of strategies seemed to work well. 

  Feedback was give in github comments on PRs, in-person, over Slack, etc.  Feedback with given and accepted in all of its many, wonderful and diverse forms.
